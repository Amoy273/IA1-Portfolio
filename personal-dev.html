            <article>
                <h2 class="highlight">Chapter 4: Achieve Your Goals</h2>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Achieving success begins with setting clear, written goals. Writing goals down gives them direction and helps turn ideas into action. By creating long-term and short-term goals, 
                    and breaking them into manageable steps, you build a clear path toward your future. Most importantly, the process of working toward your goals shapes you into a more disciplined, focused, and capable person.</p>
                <p><strong>Personal Application:</strong> I will apply this lesson by setting clear, written goals for my academics, career, and personal growth. I will break them into smaller steps and track my progress regularly. 
                    By staying focused and consistent, I will not only achieve my goals but also develop discipline and self-improvement along the way.</p>

                <h2 class="highlight">Chapter 5: The Proper Use of Time</h2>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Time is one of our most valuable resources. Each day presents many opportunities, but only one best opportunity that aligns with our goals. Success comes from choosing discipline over regret 
                    and focusing on what is important, not just what is urgent.</p>
                <p><strong>Personal Application:</strong>I will manage my time more intentionally by prioritizing activities that align with my goals. Instead of focusing only on urgent tasks, I will schedule time for personal growth 
                    and long-term success.</p>

                <h2 class="highlight">Chapter 6: Surround Yourself With the Best People</h2>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The people we associate with influence our mindset, habits, and future. Surrounding ourselves with positive, driven, and successful individuals encourages growth and better attitudes. 
                    To attract successful people, we must first work on improving ourselves.</p>
                <p><strong>Personal Application:</strong> I will evaluate the influence of the people around me and seek relationships that encourage growth and positivity. I will also focus on improving myself so I can attract
                     like-minded, motivated individuals.

            <article>
                <h2 class="highlight">Chapter 7: Be a Life-Long Learner</h2>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Formal education provides a living, but self-education builds success. Continuous learning through reading, observing successful people, and reflecting on experiences leads to personal
                     growth and achievement.</p>
                <p><strong>Personal Application:</strong>I will commit to continuous learning by reading regularly, learning from successful individuals, and reflecting on my experiences. By doing so, I will develop the knowledge 
                    and mindset needed for long-term success.</p>
